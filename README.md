# EnergyPlus HSPF Calculator
 This tool calculates the COP which will give desired EnergyPlus output for Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF) for Air-Source Direct Expansion Heat Pumps having a single-speed compressor with fixed speed indoor supply air fan.
 
 Using the user specified reference capacity, reference COP and performance curves, the DX coil models are executed for standard test conditions as specified in ANSI/AHRI 210/240. Then results of the simulated test points are processed into standard ratings according to standard's procedures.
